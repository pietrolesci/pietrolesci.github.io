I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/) advised by Prof [Andreas Vlachos](https://andreasvlachos.github.io/). 

I am interested in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. I am passionate about the science of language models: developing and applying causal methods---drawing from econometrics---to study the effect of training choices on models’ behaviour, including memorisation, shortcut learning, and tokenisation. You can find the full list of publications and the relavant links in the [/research](research) page. I also keep my [<img src="assets/img/huggingface_logo-noborder.svg" alt="Hugging Face" style="height: 1em; vertical-align: middle;"> profile](https://huggingface.co/pietrolesci) up to date: each paper is linked to a collection listing all the relevant artefacts.

3+ years experience across research labs, consulting firms, and international institutions training custom models and developing data science solutions.

Broadly, I am interested in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. I am passionate about the science of language models: developing methods—also drawing from econometrics—to study the effect of training data on models’ behaviour.
