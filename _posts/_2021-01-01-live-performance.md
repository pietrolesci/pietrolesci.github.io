Since I was 8, I studied classical piano. At the age of 12, I found my dad's old bass guitar and started
playing around with it. I fell in love instantly. In parallel to the classical piano studies, I applied
to the BAs in Jazz program at [Conservatorio di Musica Stanislao Giacomantonio](http://portale.conservatoriodicosenza.it/)
in Cosenza (IT). 
I was admitted with the Director's explicit permit for talented students which allowed me to
be admitted to an undergraduate-level course without the having a high-school diploma. During those years, I attended
the scientific highschool in the morning and the Conservatorio in the afternoon. It has been a tough but rewarding experience.

Unfortunately, by the Italian law, one can only attend one undergraduate-level course at a time. So, once I obtained my
highschool diploma, I decided to put the BAs in Jazz on pause and focus on my BSc in Economic and Management at
[Universit√† Cattolica del Sacro Cuore](https://www.unicatt.it/) in Milan (IT) - quite far from the Conservatorio...

However, I still enjoy studying and playing music. Every time I go back to my hometown, Saracena (IT), during summer or
winter holidays, I try to organize live performances with my (rock/jazz) trio in which I'm the singer and bass player - we play together since we were 12. 

Here is a nice photo of one of our performances in 2018 at Centro Commerciale Metropolis in Rende (IT) during Christmas holidays.

We usually play cover and our preferred artists are: Police, Jimi Hendrix, Doors, Beatles, Talking Heads, Rolling Stones, 
Bob Dylan, Chuck Berry, Bob Marley, etc - you got the vibe :)
